# sound-link
Ability to add Text Button in your Journals and Items text areas that will toggle a sound from your Sound Library.
The link needs to be added in the HTML part of the text editor. 
It looks like this:

```<a class="sound_link" data-playlist="PLAYLIST NAME" data-sound="SOUND NAME">Sound Name</a>```

It does require **The Furnace** module with **Advanced Macros *ON*** since it relays on its **"toggle-playlist-sound"** macro.
