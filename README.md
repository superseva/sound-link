# sound-link
Ability to add Text Button in your Journals and Items text areas that will toggle a sound from your Sound Library.
The link needs to be added in the HTML part of the text editor. 
It looks like this:

```<a class="sound_link" data-playlist="PLAYLIST NAME" data-sound="SOUND NAME">Sound Name</a>```

**IMPORTANT**

This does require **The Furnace** module installed with **Advanced Macros *ON***.

You also need to import **"toggle-playlist-sound"** macro from the *Furnace Macro Compendium* in to your game since this will be called from the sound link.
